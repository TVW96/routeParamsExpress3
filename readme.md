# Instructions
- implement a route with a parameter in its path, such as ```/user/:username``.
- Use this `parameter` in your response to personalize the message. For example if the URL is /user/john, the response shoudl be "Hello John".

This implementation allows you to create dynamic and personalized responses based on the URL parameters. By using parameters in your routes, you can handle various user-specific requests efficiently. Make sure to test different usernames to confirm that the server responds correctly.# routeParamsExpress3
